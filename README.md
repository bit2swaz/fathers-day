# Gratitude Bloom: A Digital Tribute to Dad

## Project Overview

Gratitude Bloom is an interactive web application designed as a heartfelt digital tribute for Father's Day. It features a unique, engaging user experience where users "grow" messages of gratitude by interacting with a central "seed" that blossoms into a collection of personalized messages. The application uses modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript) to deliver a fluid, mobile-first, and visually appealing experience.

## Features

-   **Interactive Hero Section:** An initial captivating screen with a pulsing "seed" that invites interaction.
-   **Dynamic Gratitude Blooms:** A scrollable section revealing individual, clickable "blooms" each containing a personalized message.
-   **Tap-to-Reveal Messages:** Users can tap on a bloom to reveal a hidden gratitude message, with a visual transformation of the bloom.
-   **Smooth Background Transitions:** The background color of the page dynamically changes as the user scrolls, creating an immersive visual journey.
-   **Scroll-Triggered Animations:** Blooms gracefully animate into view as they enter the viewport, enhancing the user experience.
-   **Custom Cursor:** A unique custom cursor provides an enhanced interactive feel for desktop users.
-   **Preloader:** A subtle preloader ensures a smooth loading experience.
-   **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing and interaction across various devices, from mobile phones to desktops.
-   **Share Functionality:** Allows users to easily share the tribute (e.g., via social media or messaging apps).
-   **Start Over Option:** A button to reset the experience and restart the gratitude journey.
